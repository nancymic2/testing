1. Confirm that you have **Node.js** and **Git** installed:
    - run the command `node -v` to see if you have **Node.js** installed.  If not, download it from <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>, and confirm that the command `node -v` runs okay.
    - run the command `git` to see if you have **Git** installed.  If not, download it from <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>, and confirm that the command `git` runs okay.

2. Clone the YaaS StoreFront:
    - Create a folder which we will refer to as `(1)` in the following steps, and `cd` into it.
    - Run `git clone https://github.com/SAP/yaas-storefront.git` to clone the StoreFront into `(1)`
    - Confirm you now see the folder `yaas-storefront`	inside `(1)`, and `cd` into it.

3. Use Node's package manager to download the dependencies:
    - The YaaS StoreFront includes `npm`, **Node.js**'s package manager, for downloading dependent packages.
    - Run `npm install` to download all the packages the Storefront depends on.  The console should show `npm` downloading many dependencies; confirm this is the case and that you have no error messages.

4. Start a local web server
    - Run the command `npm start` to start a local web server.  If your command prompt looks like the following image, you will know that the server is running.

5. Open your own default Storefront
    - Open a browser (we like Chrome) and go to `http://localhost:9000` where you should see your own StoreFront, ready for your pimping skills.
    - Verify you can see and browse products in the Storefront.

### Summary
You now have seen a default YaaS Storefront running locally on your machine. The next step is to customize and personalize it.  In the next tutorial you will add a feature to the StoreFront called "Mr Tip".  When browsing products, the undecided purchaser can click on "Mr Tip" to get advice, with helpful responses such as "Oh My God, like totally yes!!" and "One word: No".
