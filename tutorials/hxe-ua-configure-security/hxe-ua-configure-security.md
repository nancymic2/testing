## The SAP HANA, express-edition License

Installing SAP HANA 2.0, express edition installs a permanent 32 GB license automatically. No license configuration is required.

## Change the SSFS Master Keys and Root Keys

Every user who downloads SAP HANA, express edition receives the same default encryption settings. Use the **`change_key.sh`** utility to change encryption automatically.

>**Important**: SAP recommends you run **`change_key.sh`** immediately after installation to ensure your security settings are not known outside your organization.

The **`change_key.sh`** utility:

- Changes the secure stores in the file system (SSFS) master keys. The script re-encrypts the master key of the instance SSFS and re-encrypts the system PKI SSFS with a new key.

- Changes the encryption root keys. The script generates new keys, backs them up, and activates them.

>**Note**: The server will restart during the execution of **`change_key.sh`**.

Follow this procedure to run the script:

1. At the command prompt, type:
    ```
    /usr/sap/HXE/home/bin/change_key.sh
    ```

2. The script prompts you for:

Prompt         | Description  |
:-------------   | :-------------   |
HANA Instance Number       | Accept the default (90).
-s `<instance SID>`          | Accept the default (HXE).
Database System user password  | Password you set when you changed the default password for SYSTEM user during installation.
Root key backup password            | The root key backup password is required to securely back up the root keys and subsequently restore the backed-up root keys during data recovery. For information on root key backup, see [Root Key Backup](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_hanaplatform/helpdata/en/39/730482d6944173b34c660c20963051/content.htm?frameset=/en/b3/0fda1483b34628802a8d62bd5d39df/frameset.htm&current_toc=/en/de/ec02ebbb57101483bdf3194c301d2e/plain.htm&node_id=81).
Root key directory                  | A directory to store the root key backup password securely. Choose a non-temporary directory. For example `/usr/sap/HXE/HDB90`.

Wait for the script to complete (3-5 minutes). The server will restart during script execution.

A **Done** message displays when the script is finished. New data will now be encrypted with the new keys.

## Best Practices: Deactivate the SYSTEM user

SYSTEM is the database `superuser` and is not intended for day-to-day activities in production systems. For better security, you can create other database users with only the privileges that they require for their tasks (for example, user administration), then deactivate the SYSTEM user.

1. In a terminal, log in as the `hxeadm` user:

    `sudo su -l hxeadm`

2. Create a new admin user with the USER ADMIN system privilege:

    `/usr/sap/HXE/HDB90/exe/hdbsql -i 90 -d SystemDB -u SYSTEM -p <SYSTEM-password> "CREATE USER <admin-username> PASSWORD <admin-password> NO FORCE_FIRST_PASSWORD_CHANGE;"`
    `/usr/sap/HXE/HDB90/exe/hdbsql -i 90 -d SystemDB -u SYSTEM -p <SYSTEM-password> "GRANT USER ADMIN TO <admin-username> WITH ADMIN OPTION;"`

2. Use the new admin user to deactivate the SYSTEM user:

    `/usr/sap/HXE/HDB90/exe/hdbsql -i 90 -d SystemDB -u <admin-username> -p <admin-password> "ALTER USER SYSTEM DEACTIVATE USER NOW;"`
