## Details
### You will learn  
In this tutorial series, we will explore another technology for Single Page Application (SPA) development - AngularJS (or just Angular).  Angular is a popular web framework in North America, and is used by many companies for both internal and client-facing systems.  These tutorials will parallel our SAPUI5 tutorials, building a visual interface using Angular, and connecting it to an OData back end service.

### Time to Complete
**15 Min**.

**Step 5**: Start to work with the `$http` service.  This service provides a way to asynchronously get data from a server.  We will be using the [public Northwind test data service](http://www.odata.org/) to provide this test data.

### Change the test data to the OData source

1.  Remove the test data from the JavaScript file.

    In the `main.js` file, select all of the test data (starting with `var testData =`, and delete it.
    
    >Don't forget to save your file.
 
    ![delete the test data](1-1.png)   
    
2.  Change the line that defines the `productList` to start with an empty array.

    Select the line `$scope.productList = testData;`, and change it to
    
    ```javascript
    $scope.productList = [];
    ```

    ![Reset the product list to an empty array](1-2.png)   

3.  Now we want to add in the HTML call to get the OData information.  To do that, we will use the `$http` service to get the data.  

    Change the `helloController` function to get the `$http` service from Angular
    
    ```javascript
    function helloController($scope, $http) {
    ```

    ![Get the $http controller from Angular](1-3.png)   
    
4.  Now, add in the `$get` method.  

    Update your `helloController` function and add this code at the bottom:
    
    ```javascript
    var odataUrl = "//services.odata.org/V3/Northwind/Northwind.svc/";
	
	$http.get(odataUrl + "Products")
		.then( function(response) {
				$scope.productList = response.data.value;
			}, 
			function(error){
				alert("An error occurred");
			}
		);
    ```

    ![Make an OData request](1-4.png)   
    
5.  Run your application.  The data on the screen should now contain 20 rows, and look like this:
