### Time to Compete
Beginners will take **20 minutes** to finish this tutorial.

### Host Configuration
Access your HANA instance that was created in ["How to create an SAP HANA Developer Edition in the Cloud"](http://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/hana-setup-cloud.html).

Chose Notepad as the Open with Editor.

Replace the current IP address in front of the hostname ```hanapm``` with the specific IP address for this workshop which was supplied by your instructor.

Save the content and exit Notepad.

### HANA Studio Configuration
### Adding the HANA Studio Perspectives

Open the HANA Studio via the Windows Start menu or via the Icon on your Start bar.

If your HANA Studio opens to the following Overview screen, simply press Workbench to return to the full Studio tooling:

To support the new developer centric workflow, there are two additional Eclipse Perspectives which have been added to SAP HANA Studio. These are not displayed by default.

In the upper right corner of your SAP HANA Studio, there is an add Perspectives button. Press this:

![Open Perspective](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hana-configure/5.png)

Add the SAP HANA Development perspective. This is the perspective you should be using for almost this entire tutorial:

Repeat the step and add the Debug perspective:

![Debug](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hana-configure/7.png)

After adding these two new perspectives, you may also still see the initial SAP HANA Administration Console perspective as well. If so, you can right mouse click and choose Close as we will not be using this perspective:

### Create a connection to the HANA server

Make sure you are in the SAP HANA Development perspective by clicking on the button:

![Add System](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hana-configure/9.png)

Click on the ```Systems``` view.  Right click in the white space below this tab and choose ```Add System...```.

![Properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hana-configure/10.png)

Input the server hostname: ```hanapm```

Input the instance number: ```00```

Enter a meaningful description of your choice. Press the ```Next``` button:

![Description](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hana-configure/11.png)

Enter the user id and password. The user id should be ```WORKSHOP_<Group Number>```. Your group number is ```01```. For this tutorial, your user id is ```WORKSHOP_01```.

Enter the password: ```HANARocks2015```

Click Store user name and password in secure storage.

Click ```Finish```:

![Password](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hana-configure/12.png)

You should now have a new connection with your specific user id for the HANA system. Please make sure to use this connection for the rest of the exercise.

>The System ID and users shown in these screen shots might be different than the ones you are working with and will often be blurred to avoid any confusion.

### Create a Repository Workspace
Switch to the ```SAP HANA Repositories``` view. You should see the system entry you created in the previous step and a default Workspace. Right mouse click and choose ```Create Repository Workspace```:

![Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hana-configure/14.png)

Confirm the file system location on your local machine which will hold the local copy of this Workspace. Click ```Finish```:

![Finish](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hana-configure/15.png)

You should now see the local workspace mapped to the remote workspace in the SAP HANA Repositories view:

![Repositories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hana-configure/16.png)

> ### Note
>Your System ID, User ID, Hostname, and System Numbers will be different than those displayed in subsequent screen shots. For this reason we have often blurred this information in screen shots to avoid confusion.

To view what you have just created, deployed and activated you can view the URL on the server via your web browser.

You have completed the exercise! You are now able to:
- Create a connection to the HANA server
- Launch the SAP HANA Web-based Development Workbench
- Create a schema
- Create access control files
- Grant access to the schema
- Create an ```index.html``` file to test your setup
