## Details
### You will learn  
You will learn how to setup and configure the SAP HANA Cloud Platform cloud connector (briefly, cloud connector) which is the recommended way to connect applications running on SAP HANA Cloud Platform with on-premise systems.

The cloud connector is a software component, which runs as an on-premise agent in the on-premise network and acts as a reverse invoke proxy between the customer network and SAP HANA Cloud Platform. For more details on the cloud connector, please refer to the [online documentation](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/help/frameset.htm?e6c7616abb5710148cfcf3e75d96d596.html).


### Time to Complete
**20 Min**.

---

1. First, you need to download the cloud connector from the SAP HANA Cloud Platform tools page:

    <https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud>

    The cloud connector is supported for following operation systems, all with `x86_64` architecture:

    - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11
    - Redhat Enterprise Linux 6
    - Windows 7
    - Windows Server 2008 R2
    - Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion)
    - Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)

    Chose the operating system of your choice and download the SCC to the machine you like to install it.

    > This tutorial uses Windows as operating system and thus focus on the usage of the Windows MSI installer of the cloud connector. If you want to install the cloud connector on one of the other supported operating systems, please refer to the documentation how to install it on other operating systems.


2. Start the installation by double-clicking the `.msi` file, and the installer welcome screen will appear.

    ![installer welcome screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hcp-cloud-connector-setup/con100-2-installer_started.png)

 
3. Choose an installation folder for the cloud connector. The default is `C:\SAP\scc20`. If you prefer a different location, simply adjust this value.

    ![select installation folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hcp-cloud-connector-setup/con100-3-installation_folder.png)


4. Thereafter you're requested to define the administration port of the cloud connector. Don't change the default value 8443, unless the port is already blocked by some other server. In this case simply choose an arbitrary port that is still available.

    ![select port](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hcp-cloud-connector-setup/con100-4-installation_port.png) 

5. Decide, whether the cloud connector shall be started after the installation has finished. In case this is desired by you, leave the check box marked, as we do it in this tutorial. As the cloud connector is registered and started as a Windows Service, you can start it later within the `Administrative Tools/Services` administration tool in Windows (the service is named SAP HANA Cloud Connector 2.0). If you decide to not start it immediately, you can also start or stop it in the same tool whenever that is needed.

    ![select port](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hcp-cloud-connector-setup/con100-5-installation_start_after_setup.png)

6. Confirm that you really want to install the cloud connector.  As soon as the installation has finished successfully, you can press the Finish button to complete the installation.

7. Once the installation has been completed, the cloud connector should be running. You can validate this in the Windows Services viewer (start `services.msc` to bring up the Microsoft Services UI) as shown in this screenshot.

    ![select port](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hcp-cloud-connector-setup/con100-7-installer_succeeded.png)

8. To establish the connection to your HCP developer account, log on to the cloud connector administration UI by invoking the URL <https://localhost:8443> in a Web browser. 

    Your browser will warn you that an untrusted certificate is used for the HTTPS connection. This is the case as the cloud connector is delivered with a self-signed `X.509` certificate. The documentation on how to configure a certificate that is trusted by your browser can be found in the SAP HANA Cloud connector [online documentation](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/help/frameset.htm?bcd5e113c9164ae8a443325692cd5b12.html). In this tutorial, we accept the untrusted certificate. The cloud connector logon screen then is shown in the browser. As user and password, use the pre-defined credentials:

    Field          | Value
    :------------- | :-------------
    User Name      | `Administrator`
    Password       | `manage`
    
    ![cloud connector log on screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hcp-cloud-connector-setup/con100-8-scc_logon.png)


9. As first step, you are asked about the installation type of the cloud connector. Chose `Master (Primary Installation)`. The other choice `Shadow (Backup Installation)` is used for a high availability installation of the cloud connector and is not used in this tutorial.

    ![cloud connector installation type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hcp-cloud-connector-setup/con100-9-scc_master_shadow_wizard.png)


10. After the first log on, you are asked to change the initial password. Choose a strong password that cannot be guessed easily.

    ![set password](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hcp-cloud-connector-setup/con100-10-scc_change_password.png) 

11. To set the initial configuration, select `hanatrial.ondemand.com` as Landscape Host, and specify your free developer account as Account Name (e.g. `p12345678trial`).

    For the User Name and Password, use your HCP account user (e.g. `p12345678`) and your HCP password. In case your cloud connector is located within a corporate network that allows connectivity to internet resources only via a proxy, also specify the HTTPS proxy settings and click **Apply**.

    ![initial configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hcp-cloud-connector-setup/con100-11-scc_connect_to_cloud.png)
    
12. The main page of the cloud connector administration UI will appear. If the connection succeeded, you will see the **Connector State** with a yellow indicator as shown in the screenshot below. This indicates that you have a persistent SSL connection to your cloud account and are ready to use this connection in your cloud applications.

    ![connected state](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hcp-cloud-connector-setup/con100-12-scc_is_connected.png)

13. Now that you have connected the cloud connector to your cloud account, you still need to configure the on-premise resources that will be made accessible to the applications running in your cloud account. By default, **none** of the on-premise systems and resources are available after the installation of the cloud connector.


14. To configure available resources, navigate to the Access Control view in the cloud connector.

    ![map internal resources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hcp-cloud-connector-setup/con100-14-scc_add_system_mapping.png)
    
15. To add the on-premise systems click the **Add...** button in the Mapping Virtual to Internal System area. 

16. In the **Add System Mapping** dialog box, you can configure a physical on-premise system and map it to a virtual host and port. The virtual host and port are the names which must be used in the cloud applications in order to address the respective system. Besides this, you need to configure the protocol that shall be used to access the related system. Currently, HTTP and RFC are supported.

    ![add system mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hcp-cloud-connector-setup/con100-16-scc_add_system_mapping.png)

17. After a system has been added, you can configure the resources on that system to be exposed to HCP. To add a resource, select the system in the upper table, and then click the **Add...** button in the resources table on the lower part of the view. 

    For HTTP resources, the dialog box displayed will look like the screenshot below. Note that you can configure also the base path of a group of services, and use the Path and all sub-paths radio button to enable all sub-paths at once. However, use this option with care, as it might cover more HTTP services than desired.

    ![add resource](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hcp-cloud-connector-setup/con100-17-scc_add_resource.png)
