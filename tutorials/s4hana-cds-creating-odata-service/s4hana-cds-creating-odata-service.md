**Preview the content of the consumption view `ZXSHC_AIRLINEQUERY`**

- Make sure that your Eclipse Framework is opened in the ABAP perspective. In the project explorer tab select  `ZXSHC_AIRLINEQUERY` in the sub folder Core Definitions.  Right-click on that folder, select `Open With` and then press `Data Preview`, in the opened  tab on the right side, the content of the consumption view is displayed.

- Switch back to the tab **`ZXSHC_AIRLINEQUERY`** of the code editor. Mouse over the small icon preceding the line 6. In the new displayed embedded window  the following text is displayed: `...Service ZXSHC_AIRLINEQUERY is created. Activation to be done manually(/IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE/)[OData Exposure] ...` . The command `/IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE` has to be executed in the ERP System for the service Exposure.

**Service registration OData activation and OData Exposure**

- Open the ERP System SHA from the SAP Log on, enter the command(transaction) `/IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE` and execute it.

- After the execution of the command `/IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE`  the `Activate and Maintain Services` window is displayed. This is where we register the consumption view and expose it as OData.

    ![Execute the application for service registration in ERP](ApplicationForServiceRegistrationAddService.png)

- On the `Activate and Maintain Services` window , click on the icon `Add Service`  

     ![Execute the application  for service registration](ApplicationForServiceRegistrationAddService.png)

- A new window(`Add Selected Services`) get opened. In the new opened window, maintain the System Alias by pressing the `F4-Help` and selecting `LOCAL_PGW` in the system alias pop-up window.

   ![File system is filled with the alias Local](FillSystemAliasLOCAL_PGW.pnG)

- Enter as  Technical Service Name `ZXSHC_AIRLINEQUERY_CDS` (the name of the service)

   ![Service technical name is filled](FilledTechnicalServiceName.png)

- Press the icon `Get Services`, then press `Add Selected Services` and afterwards press Enter to complete this step.

- The pop-up window `Add Service` is opened with `prefilled` information therefore you don't need to make any change. Press on the icon `Local Object` to fill the package assignment(this will be filled with $TMP) and press `Enter` to continue. An information pop-up with the information `Service 'ZXSHC_AIRLINEQUERY_CDS' was created and it metadata was loaded successfully` will show up. Afterwards press Enter to complete the step.

- Switch back to the ABAP perspective. Now if you hover the icon(`1`) on the code editor you will read on the pop-up window that the view has been exposed as OData. Furthermore, if you press the `Check ABAP Developer Object` icon (`2`)

  ![Mouse hover ](MouseHoverAndClick.png)

 and afterwards hover the icon on the code editor a new pop-up window will display the information that, the OData service has been generated.

   ![Mouse hover](MouseOverLinktoODataService.png)

- In the pop-up window on the code editor, click on the link labeled `OData-Service`

   ![Link the OData service](ClickLinktoODataService.png)

 After the above link's click, your default browser will be launched.

 You are now requested to log in.
 Fill User Name as`SHA`.
 Fill Password with your current ERP System password and press `Enter`.
