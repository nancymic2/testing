6. Click **Browse** and select a directory where your downloads will be saved.

7. Select one or more of the following packages:  

    - **Server only installer** - Downloads **`hxe.tgz`**; the SAP HANA 2.0, express edition server with Application Function Library. **This file is necessary for installing SAP HANA 2.0, express edition**.  

    - **Applications** - Downloads optional package **`hxexsa.tgz`**; XSA, Web IDE, SAP HANA cockpit, and EA Designer. Download this and **`hxe.tgz`** to install those applications.  

    - **Clients** - Downloads a zip file containing four compressed client-tools bundles. Use the client packages to access developed express edition applications from a client PC. See [How to Install the SAP HANA 2.0, express edition Clients](http://www.sap.com/developer/how-tos/2016/12/hxe-ua-howto-installing-clients.html).

        - **`hdb_client_linux.tgz`** - Reduced HANA client for Linux 64 bit. Contains the HANA client package, drivers, and required licenses.

        - **`hdb_client_windows.zip`** - Reduced HANA client for Windows 64 bit. Contains the HANA client package, drivers, and required licenses.

        - **`xs.onpremise.runtime.client_linuxx86_64.zip`** - Command-line tools for Linux that enable access to (and control of) the SAP HANA XS advanced run-time environment.

        - **`xs.onpremise.runtime.client_ntamd64.zip`** - Command-line tools for Windows that enable access to (and control of) the SAP HANA XS advanced run-time environment.

     > **Tip:** After you develop an application using SAP HANA, express edition, install Download Manager to a client machine and download the *clients only* to that client machine. You can then use the clients to connect to -- and test -- your HANA application, emulating a customer.  

    - **Text analysis files for additional languages** - For languages other than English and German, these files are required for the HANA Text Analysis function. (The text analysis files for English and German are already included in the **Server only** and **Server + applications** packages.) Download this and **`hxe.tgz`** to install these files. For the text analysis files installation procedure, see *Install Text Analysis Files* at [Start Using SAP HANA 2.0, express edition](http://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/hxe-ua-getting-started-binary.html).

8. Click the **Download** button.

## Install SAP HANA 2.0, express edition
1. Navigate to the directory where you wish to extract the installation files.

2. Extract the contents of `hxe.tgz`, and `hxexsa.tgz` if you are also installing applications:

    `tar -xvzf <download_path>/hxe.tgz`
    `tar -xvzf <download_path>/hxexsa.tgz`

    >**Tip**
    > Run the tar command from the command shell as shown, rather than using a GUI-based extraction tool.

3. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the files and run `./setup_hxe.sh` as the root user:

    `cd <extracted_path>`
    `sudo ./setup_hxe.sh`

4. Follow the prompts to configure your installation.

    >**Note**
    > The master password you specify during installation is used for the `<sid>adm`,  `sapadm` OS users, the telemetry technical user, and the SYSTEM user. If you are installing the Applications package, this password is also used for the `XSA_ADMIN`, `XSA_DEV`, and `XSA_SHINE` users.

Installation of SAP HANA 2.0, express edition will take some time. Installation is successful when your command line reads `SAP HANA Express Edition System installed`.
