## Prerequisites  
 - **Proficiency:** Beginner
 - **System access:** You have developer access SAP HANA database instance, for example SAP HANA Express edition, or MDC instance in SAP HANA Cloud Platform Trial.

## Next Steps

## Details
### You will learn  
You will learn the basics of spatial processing starting with points, and use them to understand types, constructors and methods defined by SQL/MM standard implemented by SAP HANA database.

### Time to Complete
**5 Min**.

1. SAP HANA includes a spatial engine and supports spatial data types and methods to process spatial data. **Spatial data** is data that describes the position, shape, and orientation of objects in a defined space.

    >Source: SAP HANA Spatial Reference

2. Open SQL Editor of your choice (web or desktop based) connected to your SAP HANA database instance.

    Type the following SQL statement.
    ```sql
    select NEW ST_POINT(0,0) FROM DUMMY;
    ```

    This query selects a point in the 2-dimensional `2D` Euclidean space. A point defines a single location in space. A point always has an X and Y coordinate. In the example above it is a point (0, 0), ie. `X=0` and `Y=0`.

    Spatial support in SAP HANA db follows the **`ISO/IEC 13249-3` "SQL multimedia and application packages -- Part 3: Spatial"** (`SQL/MM`) standard that defines how to store, retrieve and process spatial data using SQL. It defines how spatial data is to be represented as values, and which functions are available to convert, compare, and process this data in various ways. A key component of this standard is the use of the spatial data types hierarchy. Within the hierarchy, the prefix `ST` is used for all data types (also referred to as ___classes___ or ___types___).

    The **`ST_POINT`** type is a 0-dimensional geometry and represents a single location. To get an object of the `ST_POINT` spatial type you need to call a type's constructor following the syntax **`NEW ST_Point(<x>,<y>)`**, where x and y are corresponding x/longitude and y/latitude coordinate values of data type DOUBLE.

2. Execute the query. Congratulations! You've just run your very first query using spatial capabilities of SAP HANA.

    Web-based workbench return a `?` question mark as a result of the query execution. It is because SAP HANA database stores spatial objects in the binary form. To get a human-readable value you need to apply a method **`ST_asWKT()`** to the`ST_POINT` object. ___WKT___ stands for **Well-known text**, which is a text markup language for representing vector geometry objects defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). SAP HANA is following this industry standard.

    Syntax for Spatial Functions must be in Objective-style, therefore modify the statement to this and execute.

    ```sql
    select NEW ST_POINT(0,0).ST_asWKT() FROM DUMMY;
    ```

    Now the result of the query `POINT (0 0)` can be read and understood by a human.

3. WKT standard can be used as well to define a point in the constructor.

    ```sql
    select NEW ST_POINT('POINT (0 0)').ST_asWKT() FROM DUMMY;
    ```

    will return the same result as `NEW ST_POINT(0,0)`

4. There are more spatial methods, which can be applied to`ST_POINT` objects. The complete list is available in SAP HANA documentation.

    `ST_X()` returns the X coordinate of the`ST_POINT` value as a DOUBLE data type.

    `ST_Dimension()` returns the dimension of the point or other geometry objects. In case of points the result is obviously 0.
