### Start SAP HANA 2.0, express edition

1. Start the `hypervisor` and power on (or click **Play** on) your express edition VM.

2. At the **`hxehost` login** prompt, enter **`hxeadm`**

3. For **Password** enter the temporary password **`HXEHana1`**  

    ![Entering temporary password](hxe_password_20.PNG)

4. When prompted for **current (UNIX) password**, enter the temporary password again: **`HXEHana1`**

5. When prompted for **New password**, enter a strong password with at least 8 characters. If your password is not strong enough, the system logs you off and you must log in again.  

    >**Tip:** Your strong password should contain numbers, upper and lower case letters, and special characters. It cannot contain systematic values, like strings in ascending or descending numerical or alphabetical order.  Strong password example: **`5342_E#1_GcbaFd!`**  

    >**Note:** Do not use this password example, since it is public and not secure. This example is for illustrative purposes only and must not be used on your system. Define your own strong password.

6. When prompted to **Retype new password**, enter your strong password again.

    SAP HANA, express edition is now running.

### Test your Server Installation

Verify that all required SAP HANA, express edition services are running properly.

1. From the `hxehost:hxeadm>` command prompt enter:
    ```
    HDB info
    ```  

    You should see the following services:  

    - **`hdbcompileserver`**

    - **`hdbpreprocessor`**  

    - **`hdbnameserver`**

    - **`hdbdiserver`** (Server + applications virtual machine only)

    - **`hdbwebdispatcher`**

    ![HDB info command](HXE_hdb_info_20.PNG)

    >**Note**: It can take a few minutes after server startup for all services to start. Allow all services to start running before calling HDB info.

2. If you don't see these services, restart the database.  

    Enter:  
    ```
    HDB stop && HDB start
    ```

    >**Note**: After restarting, allow sufficient time for all services to start running before proceeding.

### Change the Default Password for SYSTEM User

Changing the default SYSTEM user password can help secure your system.

1. From the command prompt, change the SYSTEM password for `SystemDB`:  
    ```
    hdbsql -i 90 -d SystemDB -u SYSTEM -p HXEHana1
    ```

    Follow the command prompts to update the password. Exit `hdbsql`:
    ```
    \q
    ```

### Change the Default Passwords for Other Users

1. Change the `XSA_ADMIN` user password for `SystemDB`:
    ```
    hdbsql -i 90 -d SystemDB -u XSA_ADMIN -p HXEHana1
    ```

    Follow the command prompts to update the password. Exit `hdbsql`:
    ```
    \q
    ```

2. Change the `XSA_DEV` password for `SystemDB`.
    ```
    hdbsql -i 90 -d SystemDB -u XSA_DEV -p HXEHana1
    ```

    Follow the command prompts to update the password. Exit `hdbsql`:
    ```
    \q
    ```

3. Change the `XSA_SHINE` password for `SystemDB`.
    ```
    hdbsql -i 90 -d SystemDB -u XSA_SHINE -p HXEHana1
    ```

    Follow the command prompts to update the password. Exit `hdbsql`:
    ```
    \q
    ```

## Record Your VM's IP Address

Record the IP address of your VM so you can reference it later to connect using SAP HANA client tools.

1. At the command prompt, enter:  
    ```
    /sbin/ifconfig
    ```

2. Locate the IP address, listed under the **`eth0`** interface as **`inet addr`**.  

    In the following example, the IP address is 172.25.86.13:  

    ![VM IP address](hxe_ua_ip_address.PNG)

### Edit the `/etc/hosts` File

You must edit the **`/etc/hosts`** file on the local machine in order to access any URL for express edition clients. For example, edit **`/etc/hosts`** if you want to access any XS Advanced applications, or HANA Cockpit.

#### Edit `/etc/hosts` on Windows

1. On your Windows laptop, navigate to **`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`**.

2. In **Administrator** mode, open **hosts** in Notepad. See your operating system Help for information on opening applications in Administrator mode.

3. In a new uncommented row, add the VM IP address and **`hxehost`**. Save your changes.

    >**Tip**: Spacing is important. Make sure your hosts file in Notepad looks like this image.

    ![Windows Host File](hxe_hosts_windows.png)

#### Edit `/etc/hosts` on Linux

1.	From your Linux host OS (not the VM guest) access your Linux client editor.

2.  Run this command:
    ```
    sudo sh -c 'echo <VM IP Address> $(hostname -f) >> /etc/hosts'\
    ```

### Test XSC, XSA, and Web IDE (Server + Applications Virtual Machine Only)

If you installed the Server + Applications Virtual Machine package (`hxexsa.ova`), test your XS installations and Web IDE.

>**Note**: Make sure you edited your **`/etc/hosts`** file before starting this procedure.

1. Check that the `XSEngine` is running. From your host OS (not the VM guest) open a browser and enter:   
    ```
    http://<ip address of VM>:8090  
    ```

    You recorded the IP address earlier in this tutorial in topic **Record Your VM's IP Address**. A success page displays. This indicates that XSC is running:  

    ![XSEngine Success Page](hxe_xs_success.PNG)

2. Go back to your VM. Log in to XSA services:  
    ```
    xs login -u XSA_ADMIN -p <password> -s SAP
    ```  

3. Check for an API endpoint showing `https://hxehost:39030`. If you see this entry, XSA installed correctly.

4. View the list of XSA applications. Enter:  
    ```
    xs apps
   ```

    >**Note**: When you run the `xs apps` command for the first time, it may take 1-2 minutes for the system to return the list of XSA applications.

5. Check that the application **`webide`** shows **STARTED** in the list of XSA applications , and has 1/1 instances. (If the list shows 0/1 in the instance column, the application is not started.)

    Make a note of the URL for `webide`.

    ![webide URL](hxe_xsa_webide.PNG)

    >**Tip**: The command **`xs apps | grep webide`** returns the `webide` row only.

6. Test your Web IDE connection. Enter the URL for Web IDE in a browser on your laptop.

    Example:  `https://hxehost:53075`

7. Log on to Web IDE using the `XSA_DEV` user. You specified the password earlier in this tutorial in the section **Change the Default Passwords for Other Users**.

8. Go back to your VM. Check that the application **`cockpit-admin-web-app`** shows **STARTED** in the list of XSA applications and has 1/1 instances.

    Make a note of the URL for `cockpit-admin-web-app`.

    ![Cockpit URL](hxe_xsa_cockpit.PNG)

    >**Tip**: The command **`xs apps | grep cockpit-admin-web-app`** returns the `cockpit-admin-web-app` row only.

9. Check that the application **`xsa-admin`** shows **STARTED** in the list of XSA applications and has 1/1 instances.

    Make a note of the URL for `xsa-admin`.

    ![XSA_ADMIN URL](hxe_xsa_xsaadmin.PNG)

    >**Tip**: The command **`xs apps | grep xsa-admin`** returns the `xsa-admin` row only.

10. In a browser on your laptop, enter the **`cockpit-admin-web-app`** URL you noted in step 8.

    The Cockpit logon page displays.

11. Log on to Cockpit as user `XSA_ADMIN`. You specified the password earlier in this tutorial in **Change the Default Passwords for Other Users**.    

12. If you are inside a corporate firewall and use a proxy for connecting to http and https servers, you need to identify your proxy settings and add them to Cockpit.

    >**Note**: If you are not inside a firewall, you can ignore this step and skip to the next topic.

    - Contact your IT administrator for your company's proxy settings.

        In this example using Internet Explorer on Windows 10, notice how connections use a proxy server on port 8080.

        ![Proxy settings](hxe_proxy.PNG)

    - In Cockpit, select **Cockpit Settings > Proxy**.

        ![Cockpit Proxy](hxe_cockpit_proxy.PNG)

    - Under **Http(s) Proxy**, select **Enable**.

        >**Note**: Enable the **Http(s) Proxy**, not the **Network Proxy**.

    - In **Host**, **Port**, and **Non Proxy Hosts**, enter the settings provided by your IT administrator.

        Make sure the host has a fully qualified domain name.

    - Click **Save**.

### Best Practices: Backups

Get in the habit of making regular data backups to save your work.

For information on data backup, recovery, and log file growth, see the [SAP HANA 2.0 Administration Guide](http://help.sap.com/saphelp_hanaplatform/helpdata/en/00/0ca1e3486640ef8b884cdf1a050fbb/frameset.htm).


### (Optional) Test your Installation using the HANA Eclipse Plugin

>**Note**: Make sure you edited your **`/etc/hosts`** file before starting this procedure.

Download and install the HANA Eclipse Plugin to your host OS (not the VM guest) and connect to SAP HANA, express edition.

1. Download **Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers** from Eclipse for [Neon](http://www.eclipse.org/neon/) or [Mars](http://www.eclipse.org/mars/) releases to your local file system.

2. Follow the eclipse installer prompts.

3. Launch when prompted, or go to the eclipse folder (example: `C:\Users\<path>\eclipse\jee-neon`) and run the **eclipse** executable file.

4. Follow the tutorial [How to download and install the HANA Eclipse plugin](http://www.sap.com/developer/how-tos/2016/09/hxe-howto-eclipse.html).

### (Optional) Install SAP Enterprise Architecture Designer (Server + Applications Virtual Machine Only)

If you installed the Server + Applications Virtual Machine package (`hxexsa.ova`), you have the option of installing the SAP Enterprise Architecture Designer (SAP EA Designer) tool.

SAP EA Designer lets you capture, analyze, and present your organization's landscapes, strategies, requirements, processes, data, and other artifacts in a shared environment. Using industry-standard notations and techniques, organizations can leverage rich metadata and use models and diagrams to drive understanding and promote shared outcomes in creating innovative systems, information sets, and processes to support goals and capabilities.

Install SAP EA Designer in your SAP HANA 2.0, express edition system using the `xs` command line tool.

>**Tip**: The SAP EA Designer installer file `XSACHANAEAD00_0.ZIP` is located at
>```    
/usr/sap/HXE/home/HANA_EXPRESS_20/DATA_UNITS
```

1. Log in as `hxeadm`.

2. Create a text file, copy the following content to it, replacing the variable <tempPwd> with your choice of a temporary administrator password for the first login, and save it as `firstTime.mtaext`:

    ```
    _schema-version: "2.0.0"
    ID: com.sap.hana.eadesigner.ext
    extends: com.sap.hana.eadesigner

    modules:
      - name: eadesigner-backend
      properties:
         ADMIN_PASSWORD: <tempPwd>
    ```    

    >**Note**: Make sure that properties and ADMIN_PASSWORD are indented with spaces (not tab). There are two spaces in front of `properties`. There are four spaces in front of `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

    >**Note**: If you do not specify this temporary password file in your installation command, the installation will proceed normally, but you will not be able to log into SAP EA Designer. We recommend that your temporary password should contain 8 or more characters including a mix of numbers and uppercase and lowercase letters. Once installation is complete, you should delete this file.

3. Login to the XSA environment with the following command and enter your credentials when prompted:
    ```
    xs login -a https://<hostname>:39030
    ```

4. Install the SAP EA Designer package using the following command, where `firstTime.mtaext` is the file containing the temporary administrator password:
    ```
    xs install XSACHANAEAD00_0.zip -e firstTime.mtaext
    ```

5. When the installation is complete enter the following command to confirm the status of SAP EA Designer:
    ```
    xs apps
    ```
    The output will include all the applications of your organization and space. You should see:   

    - `eadesigner` - The SAP EA Designer application

    - `eadesigner-service` - The SAP EA Designer Node application

    - `eadesigner-backend` - The SAP EA Designer Java application

    - `eadesigner-db` - The SAP EA Designer database creation application. This application will have a state of stopped when the installation is complete.

6. Note the URL for `eadesigner` and enter it in your web browser address bar to go to the SAP EA Designer login screen.

7. Enter the following credentials:

    - User Name - ADMIN

    >**Note**: Account names managed by SAP EA Designer are case-sensitive.

    - Password - Enter the temporary administrator password (<`tempPwd`>) you specified in `firstTime.mtaext`.

    You will be prompted to change the password and then logged in as administrator of SAP EA Designer.
