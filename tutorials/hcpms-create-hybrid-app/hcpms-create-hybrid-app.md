## Details
### You will learn  
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create (or define) an app in SAP HANA Cloud Platform mobile services for development and operations. This process is very similar to to the creation of a Destination in HCP, and allows your Development & Operations instance know how to handle incoming application requests (registration, authentication and data).

### Time to Complete
**5 Min**.
