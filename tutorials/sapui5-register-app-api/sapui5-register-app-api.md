[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 11: ](Explore your team)]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 12: ](Generate a test token)]
In order to authenticate your user in your SAPUI5 app, Slack uses OAuth 2.0. In a later tutorial, the authorization handshake for OAuth in SAPUI5 will be covered. For this tutorial series, you will generate a test token to be used.

To generate a test token for your team, go to the [Slack Tokens for Testing and Development](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens) page.

Select **Create token** for you user on your development team. This will generate a value for the _Token_ field.
