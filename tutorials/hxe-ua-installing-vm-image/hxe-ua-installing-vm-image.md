### Important Changes in SAP HANA 2.0, express edition

- The instance number has changed from `00` to `90`.
- Tenant database (HXE) is deactivated on startup to save system resources.

>**Note**: This tutorial assumes you are installing SAP HANA 2.0, express edition, not SAP HANA 1.0 SP 12, express edition. If you are installing SP 12, stop reading this tutorial and consult the documentation you downloaded with the SP 12 software package.

### What is the Virtual Machine Installation Method?

The SAP HANA 2.0, express edition VM package is platform-independent; you can install it to a Windows, OS X, or Linux machine, provided your host machine meets the storage and memory prerequisites. Choose this installation method if you want the simplest setup.

The Virtual Machine method installs:

- A VM running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) for SAP Applications 12 SP1.  

- An SAP HANA 2.0, express edition instance on the VM, preconfigured and ready to start.  

For troubleshooting information, see [SAP HANA, express edition Troubleshooting](http://www.sap.com/developer/how-tos/2016/09/hxe-ua-troubleshooting.html).


### Machine Requirements

Check if your machine has the recommended hardware to successfully install and run the express edition VM image.

#### Software

- **Java Runtime Environment 8** - The Download Manager requires Java SE Runtime Environment 8 (JRE 8) or higher.

    >**Note**: If you are planning to use the SAP HANA, express edition Download Manager for Windows or Linux, you need the 64-bit JRE. If you are planning to use the platform-independent Download Manager, you can use either the 32- or 64-bit JRE.

#### Hardware

- **RAM** - 16 GB RAM minimum. 24 GB RAM recommended.

- **HDD** 120 GB HDD recommended.

- **Cores** - 2 cores (4 recommended).  

- **Hardware `Virtualization`** - (Intel processors only) For Intel processors, `virtualization` is a BIOS setting known as either *Intel `Virtualization` Technology* or *Intel `VT`*. Go to [Determine If Your Processor Supports Intel `Virtualization` Technology](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/processors/000005486.html) to determine if your processor is capable of supporting `virtualization`. If `virtualization` is turned off on your `virtualization-capable` machine, consult documentation from your machine vendor on how to enable `virtualization` technology (or Intel `VT`) in the BIOS.

#### Install a `Hypervisor`

Install a supported `hypervisor` on your machine if you don't have one already. `Hypervisors` are software products used for creating and running virtual machines.
SAP HANA, express edition has been tested on these `hypervisors`:

- [`VMware Player 7.1`](https://www.vmware.com/)

- [`VMware Workstation Pro 12.1`](https://www.vmware.com/)

- [`VMware Fusion or VMware Fusion Pro 8.x`](https://www.vmware.com/)

- [`Oracle VirtualBox`](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

For the purposes of this tutorial, you will use the VMware Player.

#### Install VMware Player

VMware Player 7.1 is a `hypervisor` compatible with SAP HANA express edition. You can install any supported `hypervisor`, but examples in this tutorial use VMware Player 7.1.

1. Download VMware Player from [`vmware.com`](http://www.vmware.com) and run the installer.  

2. Ensure you're downloading the correct version for your machine.  

3. Register when prompted and follow the setup instructions.

### Download the VM Package using the Download Manager

Register and then use the Download Manager to download a server-only virtual machine package, or a server + applications virtual machine package. Applications include XS Advanced (XSA), Web IDE, SAP HANA Cockpit, and SAP Enterprise Architecture Designer.

1. Go to the registration page at <http://sap.com/sap-hana-express>.

    (Alternately, you can go to the SAP HANA, express edition launch page at <http://www.sap.com/developer/topics/sap-hana-express.html> and click the **Register and download SAP HANA, express edition download manager** link.)  

    The registration page opens.

2. Complete the registration form and click the **Register** button.  

    > **Note:** If you have an SAP login, click the Login icon at the top of the page to populate the registration form automatically.

    ![Registration Page](HXE_register.PNG)

    The **Registration Success** page displays. (You will also receive an email indicating successful registration.)

3. Under **SAP HANA 2.0, express edition download manager**, click the download manager that matches your system: Linux or Windows.

    If you have a Mac, or another type of machine, click `Platform-independent` for a platform-independent download manager.

    ![Registration Success page](hxe_register_success_20.PNG)

4. Save the download manager file to your laptop and open it.

    If your system displays a security warning when you open the file, ignore the warning.

    ![Windows Warning](hxe_win_warning.PNG)

    > **Note:** If you are inside a corporate firewall, you will be prompted for your proxy settings. Contact your IT administrator.

5. In Download Manager, in the **Image** pull-down, select **Virtual Machine**.

    ![Download Manager](hxe_download_mgr_20.png)    

6. Click **Browse** and select a directory where your downloads will be saved.

7. Select one or more of the following packages:  

    - **Getting Started with SAP HANA, express edition (Virtual Machine Method)** - Selected by default. Downloads this document.

    - **Server only virtual machine** - Downloads **`hxe.ova`**; the server plus Application Function Library (AFL).  

    - **Server + applications virtual machine** - Downloads **`hxexsa.ova`**; the server plus XS Advanced, Web IDE, SAP HANA Cockpit, and SAP Enterprise Architecture Designer.  

        >**Note**: Although this package will run on a 16 GB machine, SAP recommends 24 GB of RAM for optimum performance using the full suite of developer applications.

    - **Clients** - Downloads **`clients.zip`** which contains four compressed client packages. Use the client packages to access developed SAP HANA, express edition applications from a client PC. See **How to Install the SAP HANA, express edition Clients**. See [How to Install SAP HANA 2.0, express edition Clients](http://www.sap.com/developer/how-tos/2016/12/hxe-ua-howto-installing-clients.html).

        - **`hdb_client_linux.tgz`** - Reduced HANA client for Linux 64 bit. Contains the HANA client package, drivers, and required licenses.

        - **`hdb_client_windows.zip`** - Reduced HANA client for Windows 64 bit. Contains the HANA client package, drivers, and required licenses.

        - **`xs.onpremise.runtime.client_linuxx86_64.zip`** - Command-line tools for Linux that enable access to (and control of) the SAP HANA XS advanced run-time environment.

        - **`xs.onpremise.runtime.client_ntamd64.zip`** - Command-line tools for Windows that enable access to (and control of) the SAP HANA XS advanced run-time environment.

    > **Tip:** After you develop an application using SAP HANA, express edition, install Download Manager to a client machine and download the *clients only* to that client machine. You can then use the clients to connect to -- and test -- your HANA application, emulating a customer.  

    - **Text analysis files for additional languages** - For languages other than English and German, files required for the HANA Text Analysis function. (The text analysis files for English and German are already included in the **Server only virtual machine** and **Server + applications virtual machine** packages.) For the text analysis files installation procedure, see [Start Using SAP HANA 2.0, express edition](http://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/hxe-ua-getting-started-vm.html).

8. Click the **Download** button.

    Your download is complete when a pop-up message appears confirming successful download. Make sure you wait for this message before accessing the downloaded files.

### Import the OVA into `VMWare` Player

Import the downloaded Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) file (either `hxe.ova` or `hxexsa.ova`) into your `hypervisor` to begin using SAP HANA, express edition.

1. Start VMware Player 7.1 and select *Open a Virtual Machine*.  

    ![VMWare Player](hxe_vmware_import.PNG)

2. Browse to the OVA file you downloaded and click **Open**. The Import Virtual Machine dialog box displays.

3. Accept the defaults and click **Import**. The VM imports. The import process takes approximately 5 minutes for `hxe.ova`, and 5-10 minutes for `hxexsa.ova`.

4. Power on your VM.
