    > ### Note
    > In this example screenshots from SAP BusinessObjects Lumira version 1.31 in English are being used. They may be slightly different between versions and application languages.

2. Create a new Dataset by selecting **Microsoft Excel** as a source, pressing **Next**, and then selecting `BestRunCorp_Retail.xlsx` file from the your user's directory `...\Documents\SAP Lumira Documents\Samples\`. SAP BusinessObjects Lumira installation comes with a few sample files, and this MS Excel file with data is just one of them.

    > If for any reason you do not have that file or that directory in your local installation, then download [`BestRunCorp_Retail.xlsx`](./BestRunCorp_Retail.xlsx) file.

3. Dataset preview is displayed. At this stage you can decide what columns from the dataset are needed for further analysis. You will not need **Year-Quarter** and **GMR** (Gross Margin) columns, so uncheck them.

    Click **Create**.

5. SAP BusinessObjects Lumira opens the dataset in the new document ready for data discovery and visualizations. One of so called 'rooms' is open for your further activities: **Prepare**, **Visualize**, or **Compose**.

    > It depends on the preferences settings accessible from **File** -> **Preferences** -> **General** -> **Default Room**
