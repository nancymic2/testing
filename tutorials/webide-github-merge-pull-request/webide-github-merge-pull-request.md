5. Once you click on **Merge Pull request**, you will see a button **Confirm merge**. Clicking on the drop-down besides the button allows you to select a merge option of your choice - select **Squash merge** if you want a single commit of all changes or  **merge commit** if you want all commits from the other branch.

7. You will notice that the issues are automatically closed as well and the milestone is complete. 

    > GitHub will automatically close an issue if your commit message includes [certain keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) once this change is merged into the master branch.
