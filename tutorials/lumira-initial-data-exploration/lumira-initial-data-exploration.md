1. Make sure you opened the Prepare room of SAP BusinessObjects Lumira to explore the data acquired in the previous tutorial.

    In Status bar check how many rows and columns are in the dataset. In this example the dataset has 16317 rows with 13 columns and all are displayed.

    ![Dataset view in Grid view of the Prepare room](Lum02-01.png)

    All of columns became **Dimensions** to analyse data. Dimensions with numeric data have been additionally recognized by SAP BusinessObjects Lumira as **Measures**, which can be used for numerical analysis using different types of aggregation. Aggregation of the type `Sum` is the default for all measures.

2. To better understand values of dimensions in your dataset switch display of the Data pane to **Facets**.

    Now each facet displays a list of unique values of corresponding dimension. And you can see the number of unique values in the given dimension right next the to facet's name. In this case there are 32 distinct values of `Country` in example above.

    If a dimension has more than 100 values, like in case of the **Date** dimension, then `100+` is displayed by default. Click on it to force the facet view to calculate the exact number of distinct values of corresponding dimension.

3. Right click on the Facet's value highlights all related values from other dimensions, i.e. all values which appear in same rows with the selected one. Right click on `Australia`, and you see `Melbourne` and `Sydney` highlighted in the **City** facet.

4. Facet's values are ordered alphabetically by default and display the number of occurrences next to each value.

    Click on **Options** button next to the `Lines` Facet's name, and change the measure from **Occurrences** to **Sales Revenue**.

5. To find top selling lines of products change the sort order by clicking on **Options** button next to **Lines** facet's name and selecting **Sort** -> **Sort Measure Descending**.

    You can see that top selling line of products is `Sweat-T-Shirts`.

6. And to find what lines of products are best selling in `Australia`, add the filter by clicking on **Options** button and then selecting **Filter...** to open a dialog box. Select `Australia` and then click **Apply**.

    You should notice that Austria has been added as a filter in **Filters bar**. Remove it from there by clicking `x` after you analysed filtered data.
