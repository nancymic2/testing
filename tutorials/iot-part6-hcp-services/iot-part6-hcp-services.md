## Details
### You will learn  

This tutorial will detail the steps needed to simply the process of connecting your hardware device to SAP. As you saw in the previous section connecting our device directly to an SAP HANA server left plenty of room for errors as well as a number of security holes.
SAP's IoT Services provide a robust and secure way of connecting your device as well as simplified way of specifying your data structures and changing those structures.

This procedure assumes you are using the trial edition of the SAP HANA Cloud Platform, but you can use a production account if you have one.  

### Time to Complete
**15 Min**.

---
1. Go to the [SAP HANA Cloud Platform trial edition](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/cockpit) log in (or sign up if you don't have an account yet).

2. One you log in, click on **Services** in the left-hand navigation bar, scroll down to find **Internet of Things Services** and click on that tile.

5. With IoT services enabled, you can begin the steps necessary to connect your device and enable message communication. The first step will be to configure and deploy the Message Management Service (MMS). Click on the **Deploy Message Management Service** tile.

6. Enter in your information in the fields, where your account ID is your p-number (or s-number if you are SAP's customer or partner, or i-/d-number if you are SAP employee) with the world "trial" (no space between the p-number and trial) and your user name is just your p-number.￼

Return to the HCP Cockpit view and click on **Java Applications** in the left navigation bar. You will see the new `iotmms` application you just deployed. Click on the `iotmms` link to display the **IoT MMS dashboard**.
