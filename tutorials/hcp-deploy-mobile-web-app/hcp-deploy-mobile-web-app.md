## Details

### You will learn
After creating your app in SAP WEB IDE, you will now deploy it to your HANA Cloud Platform trial account and be able to see it on a mobile device.

Since any project that is created initially in the SAP Web IDE contains a `neo-app.json` file, it is ready to be deployed to HANA Cloud Platform. During the deployment process, Web IDE creates the HTML5 application in HANA Cloud Platform and also the related Git repository (which will track code changes) for your app automatically.

### Time to Complete
**5 min**


1. Open the SAP Web IDE.

2. In SAP Web IDE, select the **northwind** project folder and open the context menu by right-clicking on it. Choose **Deploy > Deploy to SAP HANA Cloud Platform**.

3. If this is your first time deploying an app to the SAP HANA Cloud Platform, you may see a dialog box requesting information to configure your Git repository. Enter your **email** and **username** and click **OK**.

5. Because all HTML application names on HCP are lower case, the application name will be converted (if required) to lower-case letters. Check the **Connect to the SAP HANA Cloud Platform Git repository...** checkbox, verify the version number is **1.0.0** and the **Activate** check box is marked. Click on **Deploy**.

6. The deployment process will take a few seconds, and after it has finished, you will see a success message.

7. Click on **Open the active version of the application** link to see your app running on HCP. Your app should look like this:
